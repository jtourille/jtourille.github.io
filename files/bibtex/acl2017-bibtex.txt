  abstract  = {We present a neural architecture for containment relation identification
	between medical events and/or temporal expressions. We experiment on a corpus
	of de-identified clinical notes in English from the Mayo Clinic, namely the
	THYME corpus. Our model achieves an F-measure of 0.613 and outperforms the best
	result reported on this corpus to date.},
