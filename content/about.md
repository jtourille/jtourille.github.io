# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my website

I am an NLP research engineer in the R&D department of EDF [^1], a French state-owned multinational electric utility company. My role encompasses several key objectives:

1. **Technical and Scientific Monitoring**. I keep myself up-to-date with the literature by reading scientific papers, reviewing for the main NLP conferences, and attending seminars. I also monitor closely social platforms and a selected number of blogs.
2. **Applied Research en Prototyping**. I evaluate promising technologies identified during my monitoring activities by developing Proofs-of-Concept (PoCs). I lead and contribute to designing technical solutions that assess the viability of new NLP technologies for specific needs within EDF.
3. **Benchmarking Off-the-Shelf Solutions**. I assist other EDF divisions in selecting the right tools for their needs. This involves developing custom benchmarks and evaluation frameworks using internal data to rigorously assess the performance of candidate solutions.
4. **Driving the Generative AI Community**. I actively contribute to EDF's internal Generative AI community to help leverage its potential across the company. My contributions include developing software, leading workshops, providing training, and sharing my expertise in the NLP field.
5. **Leading a Research Program**. A core part of my role is conducting research. I am particularly interested in encoder models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures. In this capacity, I regularly supervise PhD theses and graduate-level internships.
